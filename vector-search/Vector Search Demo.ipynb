This warranty is available only on vehicles purchased and operated in Canada.\\nIn all other countries, defective parts will be repaired or replaced free of charge only in accordance with the terms and limitations of the warranty for new Mercedes-Benz vehicles in effect at the time in such countries.\\nThe law requires your vehicle to confirm to exhaust emission standards. To provide the best vehicle performance and lowest vehicle emissions, you are responsible to see that all recommended maintenance procedures detailed in the Service Information booklet are performed at the specified times and km. The emission control system warranty does not cover failures due solely to owner abuse or lack of proper maintenance.\\nMore frequent maintenance may be needed for vehicles under severe operating conditions such as dusty areas, very short trip driving or trailer towing.\\nWe recommend that all maintenance services be performed by your authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer who is equipped with the tools, instruments, and literature necessary for correct and systematic performance of these services. We recommend the use of Genuine Mercedes-Benz spare parts for service and repairs, since they have been made according to the manufacturer’s specifications. It is also important to use only fuels and lubricants meeting factory specifications, since the emission control systems warranty does not cover repair or replacement of parts necessitated by failure of such items.\\n\"}},{\"detected_page_number\":\"pg. 19\",\"footer\":\"pg. 19\",\"header\":null,\"page_index\":17,\"representation\":{\"markdown\":\"# Emission Performance Warranty\\n\\nNOTE: The Emission Performance Warranty applies only in those jurisdictions that have periodic vehicle emissions tests and require the vehicle to pass such tests and is effective only to the extent required by law.\\n\\nMercedes-Benz AG (MBAG) warrants to the original and each subsequent owner of a new Mercedes-Benz vehicle that:\\n- If the vehicle is maintained and operated in accordance with MBC’s written instructions for required maintenance and use, and\\n- If the vehicle fails to conform at any time during 8 years or 130,000 km, whichever first occurs, to the applicable emission standards as ascertained by the applicable emission tests, then\\n- If such non-conformity results or will result in the vehicle owner having to bear any penalty or other sanction (including the denial of the right to use the vehicle) under any law applicable, then any authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer during the first 24 months or 40,000 km will make any repairs or replacements necessary to specified systems/components to ensure that the vehicle conforms to the applicable standards at no charge for parts and labour (including diagnosis); and\\n- For the remainder of the 8 years or 130,000 km the authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer will correct only those deficiencies directly related to the specified components (pages 21-23) which have been installed in or on the vehicle for the sole or primary purpose of reducing vehicle emissions.\\n\\nParts replaced under this warranty become the property of the warrantor.

The decision whether a part should be repaired or replaced will be made by the servicing Toyota dealership and/or Toyota. Parts scheduled to be replaced as required maintenance are warranted until their first replacement only.\\nWho Is the Warrantor\\nThe warrantor for these limited warranties is Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (“Toyota”), a California corporation, P.O. Box 259001, Plano, Texas 75025-9001.\\nWhich Vehicles Are Covered\\nThese warranties apply to all 2024 model-year Corolla vehicles distributed by Toyota that are originally sold by an authorized dealer in the United States and normally operated or touring in the United States, U.S. territories or Canada.

The scheduled maintenance log indicates at which mileage/time intervals each item should be performed. Please note that many maintenance items should be performed only by a qualified technician.\\n\\nFor further information on maintenance items you can perform yourself, see the “Maintenance and Care” section of the Owner’s Manual.\\n\\n## Automatic Transmission Fluid\\n\\nInspect or replace at specified intervals. When performing inspections, check each component for signs of leakage. If you discover any leakage, have it repaired by a qualified technician immediately.\\n\\n## Ball Joints and Dust Covers\\n\\nCheck the suspension and steering linkage ball joints for looseness and damage. Check all dust covers for deterioration and damage. Replace any deteriorated or damaged parts. A qualified technician should perform these operations.\\n\\n## Brake Lines and Hoses\\n\\nVisually inspect for proper installation. Check for chafing, cracks, deterioration and signs of leakage. Replace any deteriorated or damaged parts.
