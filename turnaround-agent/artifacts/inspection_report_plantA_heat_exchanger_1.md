# Inspection Report

### Metadata  
**Plant ID**: A  
**Equipment**: Heat Exchanger  
**Equipment ID**: 1  

---

### Summary  
The heat exchanger was found to be in good condition. The only noted problems were a bent tie rod and surface corrosion on the baffle. Neither of these are of concern.

---

### Overall Condition  
- Good

---

### Findings  
- There was a single bent tie rod with a deflection angle of 10 degrees  
- There is minor, superficial corrosion on the baffles  
- The tube sheet is in clean condition with no blockage from corrosion  

---

### Repairs Done  
- Cleaned external surfaces  
- The bent tie-rod is not impacting performance and was not repaired  
- A high-pressure wash was not done as corrosion is minimal  

---

### Future Suggested Repairs  
- Continue to monitor bent tie-rod and baffle corrosion  
- Check tube sheet corrosion  
- If corrosion worsens, do high-pressure wash and consider replacing tube sheet
